# drone-flight-planner
A Django REST Framework (DRF) based web application for generating optimized flight paths for drones using polygon coordinates. Users can create polygons via an API, customize image overlap percentages, and receive an XML file with waypoints. Features robust error handling and efficient flight path algorithms.


# Setup

   1. Clone the repository:
       git clone https://github.com/akashrajk54/DroneFlightPlanner/tree/development

   2. Navigate to the project directory:
       cd DroneFlightPlanner

   3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
       python -m venv venv

   4. Activate the virtual environment:
      a). Windows:
          venv\Scripts\activate
      b). Linux/macOS:
          source venv/bin/activate

   5. Install dependencies:
      pip install -r requirements.txt

   6. Set up environment variables by creating a .env file:
       # DATABASE Use: PostgresSQL
       DATABASE_NAME=''
       DATABASE_USER=''
       DATABASE_PASSWORD=''
       DATABASE_HOST='localhost'
       DATABASE_PORT='5432'

       MAX_TIME_LIMIT_TO_VERIFY_OTP='3' (otp valid max 3min)

       TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=''
       TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=''
       TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=''

       # During production 
            Debug = False
            ALLOWED_HOSTS = insted of ['*'], please add specific frontend url, so that request from anyother will be rejected.
       # Please Update DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES into the settings currently set to 100/Hours

   7. Run migrations to create the database schema:
      python manage.py makemigrations
      python manage.py migrate

   8. Create a superuser (admin) account:
      python manage.py createsuperuser

   9. Run the development server:
      python manage.py runserver
      (by default it will use 8000 port)
